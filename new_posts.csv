t3f6n5,"[WTS] [EU-UK] [H] Audeze LCD-5 with hard carrycase [W] Paypal, BT","For sale **Audeze LCD-5** headphones, just over a month old, RRP £3999.

This headphone is second to none and the flagship for Audeze.   

The LCD-5 has been redesigned, and is notably smaller and as a result far more comfortable than previous LCDs I have tried, yet still sounds outstanding.

**Asking for £2999**

https://preview.redd.it/wglxtyt7nkk81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bad02171bfc0b70ffe6014f106402c92c66806b6

It comes in original case with ¼” cable, gloves and all other accessories, purchased from an authorised dealer approx. 1 month ago and therefore has a practically full and transferrable warranty.

Condition is mint throughout with minimal usage, not even burnt in as yet.

I have a number of TOTL headphones I am selling as I am having a shift over to high-end IEMs, each are great in their own way and so I will simply keep hold of the last can to sell.

t4ymtz,[UK] [H] Meletrix Zoom65 (Dark Olivia) [W] PayPal,"[TIMESTAMP](https://imgur.com/a/OBN5Nty)

Selling my Meletrix Zoom65 which has been fully built with all included gaskets and case foam. I have installed lubed Owlstabs (which are included with this listing) \[don't worry, the original Wuque Studios stabs are included in the box too).

After it was built I used this for two typing tests - This is sold in almost new condition as a result. Unfortunately the PE foam sound profile just isn't for me, but I can confirm this sounds so similar to a Mr. Suit and the build quality is fantastic.

The Dark Olivia keycaps remain unused and are also included alongside the JWICK switches (stock and unused).

~~GBP 260.00~~  **GBP 240.00** shipped within UK \[fully insured and tracked\]. Willing to ship outside of the UK, at your expense - PM me for a quote. Payment via PayPal only.

I am open to reasonable offers. Please bear in mind that import tax has already been paid, as I got this from the last limited in-stock run from Ilumkb (50 units only).

Please comment before PM. Thank you.

IMPORTANT: THE GMK DRACULA KEYCAPS SHOWN IN THE PHOTO ARE **NOT** INCLUDED, NOR ARE THE SWITCHES THEY SIT ON. ",2022-03-02 07:01:03,GMK Olivia,https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/comments/t4ymtz/uk_h_meletrix_zoom65_dark_olivia_w_paypal/
