t1ea25,"[WTS] [US-TX] [H] Audeze LCD-2C w/ extra balanced cable, Beyerdynamic DT-150, Audeze iSine20, Sennheiser HD800S, miniDSP 2x4 HD, Genelec 8040A Studio Monitors [W] Paypal","Selling quite a few things due to currently being unemployed, feel free to PM for more details. As with most things in this post, I never had any intention of having to sell any of them and I want to make it very clear that although there are obvious cosmetic issues, everything works perfectly still. At this time, I'm also not looking to do any trades since I need money for bills. I am open to negotiation for everything listed. I am only shipping to CONUS and I will include insurance with everything. We will split the cost of shipping depending on your preferred shipping method.

1. Audeze LCD-2C w/ original SE cable and I'm throwing in an additional NewFantasia HiFi balanced cable. I've been the original owner and as you can see the pads have pretty heavy use on them to the point of the leather coming off. Doesn't affect tone/sound in any way. Doesn't come with a box or anything, but I do have the e-mailed receipt still if you need it. Looking at $450 OBO.
2. Beyerdynamic DT-150 These are still in great condition other than the fact that the internal pad has a cut. Not sure if that makes a difference in sound because I have not been able to hear any difference at all personally. Looking at $150 OBO.
3. Audeze iSine 20. This one might be the strangest out of the bunch that I'm selling for a couple of reasons. When I first purchased them, I had also purchased the Cipher bluetooth cable since it was apparently necessary to enjoy the IEM's to their best capability. Audeze however sent me a pair that were loose, and as a result they ended up sending me another pair that fits perfectly. So, as it stands I currently have the original 3.5 cable, a loose-fitting (but works perfectly) Cipher cable, and another Cipher cable. There is a deep scratch on the housing of the Right side of the IEM but again this is purely cosmetic. I have been the original owner and I still have the original box, but I no longer have any of the earhooks (you can buy a set still for $25 from Audeze). Looking at $400 OBO.
4. Sennheiser HD800S. I bought these used from [headphones.com](https://headphones.com) because I wanted something with a really open soundstage. I really am sad about letting these go because I love the sound, but I absolutely loathe the feeling of the fabric they use for the earpads. Not sure what it is, but I just hate the feeling of that specific fabric. Comes with the original box and everything that is originally included. Looking at $1100 OBO.
5. miniDSP 2x4 HD. I am the original owner of these as well, and I'm only selling them since I ended up changing my setup to something that no longer required this. Comes with the original cable and power supply but I no longer have the box. I can also throw in a pair of 1 Foot RCA Gotham GAC Cables since I also don't need them. Looking at $200 OBO
6. Genelec 8040A Studio Monitors. This is the one piece of gear I really, really don't want to let go of but alas. I have a pair of them and they're both in pretty good condition. I bought them secondhand from a local studio, and they have never let me down. The only thing I did was purchase new power cables since they didn't come with any. Looking at $800 each or $1500 for both OBO.

For sale I have a special Pre-fazor LCD - X with a custom paint job (and comfy head band). I've had these for a little over a year now, but based on how they've spent nearly 90% of their time with me in their case its felt like an eternity.

szltmv,"[WTS][US-MA][H] Ampsandsound Kenzie Encore Deluxe w/lifetime tube supply, Bottlehead crack w/Speedball + extra tubes [W] PayPal or Local","Stamp that time: [https://imgur.com/a/BpKFNwL](https://imgur.com/a/BpKFNwL)

Hello fellow AVswappers!  I am cleaning house and letting go of two tube headphone amps.

**~~Ampsandsound Kenzie Encore Deluxe~~** **SOLD**

This thing is an absolute monster - only with my LCD-4 can I turn it more than 1/5 of the way up from zero.  Only a few dozen or so of the Encore Deluxe were made.  It differs from the standard Encore with the addition of Input transformers, and upgraded Auri-brand coupling capacitors.  I won't tell you too much about it, but if you want to read more, check this out: [https://headphone.guru/the-ampsandsound-kenzie-encore-what-an-encore-performance/](https://headphone.guru/the-ampsandsound-kenzie-encore-what-an-encore-performance/) .   By the numbers, this one sits somewhere between the current ""Kenzie OG"" and ""Kenzie Ovation"".  Couple of small dings on the corners and on one top edge, which I have tried to capture in the photos.

Included with this beast are more tubes than you will need to last the rest of your life (Over 8 full sets of tubes (28 in total) - most are NOS with several matched pairs of 1626s (20 tubes in total):  Tung-Sol, RCA, Hytron, US Army, and Sylvania.  For the 12SL7GTs there are a total of 8 from Sylvania and RCA)

I also have the OG ""suitcase"" (pelican-style ballistic hard case with wheels and an extendable handle) - but that will add about $50 to the shipping cost due to it's shear size.  Totally your call if you want it.

Original Price: $2550, with a very conservative $300 worth of tubes (probably closer to $500).  No power cable (if you want a cheap one, I can toss one in - any standard PC power cable will work, although most hardcore folks will tell you an upgraded power cable is worth it).  **~~Asking $1650 plus shipping~~** ~~(Shipping will likely run around $60-$75 in the states - with the case it'll probably be $125)~~   **Sold** elsewhere

&#x200B;

**~~Built Bottlehead Crack with Speedball upgrade~~** **SOLD**

For the ""tube-noob"" and/or budget conscious individual who wants a tube headphone amp that doesn't break the bank, but will perform as well as something 2-3 times the price.  This was a ""hey, let's build a tube amp"" idea I got into my head at the start of the pandemic.  Turned out great (aside from the finish - I never claimed to be a woodworker or any good with a paintbrush), and definitely a powerhouse!

Comes with the original tubes provided by BH (in the box on the right in the photo), a set of upgraded tubes currently mounted on it, and a basic power cable.  Yes, the finish isn't great, and there are some scuffs on the matte-black paint on the plate, but it cranks.

Original Price: $464 for the crack kit with the speedball upgrade kit, $35 for the extra tubes.  A lot of folks will ADD cost to the base kit price when selling a built unit (and I get it, it takes more than a few hours to put one of these together), but that was the whole reason I bought it - just to build it.  So, call me crazy, but I am **~~Asking $425 plus shipping~~**  ~~(Shipping will probably run $20-$40 in the states)~~ **SOLD** to u/[Spanglers\_Army](https://www.reddit.com/user/Spanglers_Army/) for asking

&#x200B;

Please comment before sending a PM - happy to meet up locally in the Newton/Needham/Wellesley/Dover area and let you audition them with some high-end cans or bring your own (I've got too many, and can probably help you out there if need be).

&#x200B;

Payment for shipped items will be through PayPal Invoice (fees are included in the price, shipping will depend on your zip - so send that for an accurate quote).  Local payment has more options (paid upon delivery/pick-up).  Offers will be entertained, but please no lowballs - I'd like to think my asking prices are more than reasonable, but I am happy to work with you to get either (or both) of these in your hands.",2022-02-23 11:43:20,LCD 2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AVexchange/comments/szltmv/wtsusmah_ampsandsound_kenzie_encore_deluxe/

They come with their original 1/4"" cable and the authenticity card.  The pads and headband are still in good condition.

I'll  keep this post short as possible, as I have a bunch of other things to  list. I think I reached a point where I can no longer tell the  difference between headphones and decided to sell off my entire audio  collection for a simple dac/amp combo.

Now,  for sale I have a special Pre-fazor LCD - X with a custom paint job (and comfy head band). I've had these for a little over a year now, but based on how they've spent nearly 90% of their time with me in their case its felt like an eternity. These headphones will smoke the current revision of the LCD - X (I've went and demoed the 2018 and 2021 revisions) while looking amazing on your head. 

&#x200B;

Included with these pieces of art are: Custom Sheep Skin Strap, upgraded Carbon Fiber Headband Custom Paint ""V"" job, Audeze hard case, Dekoni Elite Velour Pads(attached), and stock pads.

&#x200B;

**I'm  looking to sell all my audio gear relatively quickly, and as such I'm open to negotiate on the price to get these art pieces to you. In total, I  would like to get $1100 shipped for everything seen but as I said I'm  willing to hear all reasonable offers (or trade + cash for an empyrean).**

Hi all, reposting these with updated photos due to a buyer that fell through.

I have a ZMF Auteur LTD Padauk with Magnesium Chassis. Completed November 2019 and fully functional. Includes Auteur, seahorse case, original 1/4"" cable, 3 sets of pads, leather ZMF pouch with allen wrenches, owner card. Please see photos for exact condition:

I would be interested in trading for the following or anything else interesting you might have, plus PayPal for any difference in the trade value:

Focal Clear MG

Abyss Diana v2

Meze Empyrean Copper

LCD-4

Prefer trades that are complete with case, pads/cables if originally included, etc. Will request timestamps before we finalize. Also prefer to trade with folks that have some trade history.

These would have originally sold for $2100+ -- would be open to $1300 OBO for outright purchase.

EDIT: I'm actually open to selling as well. I'd be aiming for $1100 which includes the stock accessories and the dekoni elite hybrid pads ($100 value). 

Hello all!

I have a set of 800s that I'm looking to move on from.  I have some dekoni elite hybrids that will come with these as well.  Original box, only had them for a couple months from headphones.com.  In fantastic shape!

Instead of selling, I figured I'd look for a trade.  I'd really like to try the Arya v3.  I'd also really like to try the Verite either open or closed.  I realize the Verite is worth more, so we can work on the difference, but the Arya should be in the ballpark (I can still pay for a difference).

I'm open to other offers as well that I might not be thinking of.  I do have an LCD-X 2021 and a Focal Clear OG, so not interested in either of those.

Hello, back with another post! I spent money on things better than keyboards, and I'm also running out of space to keep things. I want all these things to go to new homes.

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices are PayPal G&S and include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs unless otherwise stated. Since I've had issues with my own mail recently, I will not downgrade to First Class mail to save you $2 on shipping cost. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours. Add $20 if you'd like me to upgrade to Priority Mail Express shipping.

No local meetups available at the moment. I am also posting this while out of town, so I won't be able to get additional pictures of items. Please refer to my outlined terms of sale at the bottom of the post regarding asking for additional pictures as well.

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
GMK Serika base/novelties/spacebars | From the original run conducted through Massdrop when Drop was still called that. Bought this set off of mechmarket as part of a bundle to get something I wanted, but I haven't really had the desire to mount the set at all ever since I got it because I've been liking beige sets and WoB too much. Small amount of shine on alphas and spacebar from previous owner(s), not surprising for such an old set. Spacebars and novelties kits are sealed. Base kit will be shipped in bags because I cannot find a box to accommodate older GMK trays. no splitting kits allowed unless all kits have separate buyers. | $320 shipped | yes!
Bunnybox artisan box | small aluminum artisan box a friend designed for a small run (not a 1/1 unit). 15 slots, comes with acrylic cover and 3D-printed stand. selling because I have a new small artisan box on the way. includes a small 3D-printed stand for steeper display angle (not pictured). price is less than what I paid for the box originally. | $80 shipped | yes!
TTC Matrix-01 switches x90 | linear variant. wanted to try them, but I have no boards to build them with at all. price is less than I paid when I bought them. | $60 shipped | yes!
KBDfans HiPro keycaps | for Topre keyboards. includes base and extras kits, no splitting. they've just been sitting in my drawer and I don't even have another board I want to use them on. never mounted. | $110 shipped | yes!
WT60-D WEIRDFLEX PCB | dark gray variant. soldered once, and then cleanly desoldered with an FR-301 desoldering gun. two flex cuts for the flex, cause apparently that's the cool thing to have. I haven't had a 60% board in months, so there's no use for this thing. | $70 shipped | yes!

**PLEASE INCLUDE AN OFFER OR SOMETHING WITH YOUR PM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY MY ASKING PRICE. IT SIMPLY WASTES MY TIME AND YOURS IF YOU ONLY TELL ME THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM.**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing bundle of items for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and sending an offer that I'll accept on any item listed above

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner.

Hello, back with another post! I spent money on things better than keyboards, and I'm also running out of space to keep things. I want all these things to go to new homes.

Only shipping to USA addresses at the moment. All prices are PayPal G&S and include **USPS Priority Mail** shipping costs unless otherwise stated. Please feel free to offer if it means that these things get out of my hands and into yours. Add $20 if you'd like me to upgrade to Priority Mail Express shipping.

No local meetups available at the moment.

Item|Details|Price|Available
:--|:--|:--|:--
GMK Serika base/novelties/spacebars | From the original run conducted through Massdrop when Drop was still called that. Bought this set off of mechmarket as part of a bundle to get something I wanted, but I haven't really had the desire to mount the set at all ever since I got it because I've been liking beige sets and WoB too much. Small amount of shine on alphas and spacebar from previous owner(s), not surprising for such an old set. Spacebars and novelties kits are sealed. Base kit will be shipped in bags because I cannot find a box to accommodate older GMK trays. | $330 shipped | yes!
Bunnybox artisan box | small aluminum artisan box a friend designed for a small run (not a 1/1 unit). 15 slots, comes with acrylic cover and 3D-printed stand. selling because I have a new small artisan box on the way. includes a small 3D-printed stand for steeper display angle (not pictured). price is what I paid for the box. | $85 shipped | yes!
TTC Matrix-01 switches x90 | linear variant. wanted to try them, but I have no boards to build them with at all. | $65 shipped | yes!
KBDfans HiPro keycaps | for Topre keyboards. includes base and extras kits. they've just been sitting in my drawer and I don't even have another board I want to use them on. never mounted. | $110 shipped | yes!
WT60-D WEIRDFLEX PCB | dark gray variant. soldered once, and then cleanly desoldered with an FR-301 desoldering gun. two flex cuts for the flex, cause apparently that's the cool thing to have. I haven't had a 60% board in months, so there's no use for this thing | $70 shipped | yes!

**PLEASE INCLUDE AN OFFER OR SOMETHING WITH YOUR PM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY MY ASKING PRICE. IT SIMPLY WASTES MY TIME AND YOURS IF YOU ONLY TELL ME THAT YOU WANT THE ITEM.**

Priority for responding to offers will be as follows:

 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing bundle of items for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and purchasing any one item for asking price
 * **PayPal email included in your initial PM** and sending an offer that I'll accept on any item listed above

Outside of the listed conditions, I'll check based on when you comment **and** PM. The PM is absolutely necessary for the sale of these items. Since I've had this happen before, if there are two people interested in the same item, but one is willing to pay no questions asked while the other has questions or wants to see more pics, I'm 100% selling to the person who will pay no questions asked. Requests for additional pictures will also take longer than you think, so please consider that when trying to secure an item.

Please understand that if you as a buyer and I agree on a price and you back out of the purchase right after I send the invoice, I will refuse to sell anything to you in the future (yes, that includes if you offer me something like $300 on something that I'm selling for much less). 

 **Do not use the chat function**, I honestly don't know how you are taken to the chat function when the bot's verification post gives you a link to PM sellers. I will ignore you and you won't be in consideration for anything until you send me a PM. I will also ignore you if you do not comment before sending a PM.

If I don't respond, it's likely because I'm just busy doing other things. I will get to all messages accompanying comments in a timely manner.
